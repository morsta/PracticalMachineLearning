Repository for the Practical Machine Learning Course from JHU

This is my approach on solving the Course Project excercise. It is about predicting "the manner in which [participants] did [a] exercise" - given a datset with 160 variables and 19622 observations.
The result is a model with 98.5% accuracy based on only 11 predictors.
The data can be obtained from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
Make sure the data is in your working directory, if you like to run the code on your own.
